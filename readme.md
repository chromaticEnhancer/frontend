# Problem Statement
- A GUI interface built in React/Tailwind
- Takes an image as an input
- Fetches the data to API
- Display the output/error of the API in their respective way
---
# Non-functional Requirements
- Simple/Minimal
- Contains two sections one for input image and another for output
- Error can be shown as toast notification or windows.alert()
- Will be better if we can implement Drag&Drop feature
